\title{Calculate Vegetation Index from Landsat surface reflectance data file}
\usage{
sr2vi(x, vi = "ndvi", e = NULL, mask = NULL, keep = c(0), L = 0.5,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character. File name of the hdf file containing the bands, or list of filenames (geoTiffs).}

\item{vi}{Character. Vegetation index to be computed. 'ndvi', 'evi' and 'savi' are supported at the moment. The function will first attempt to find if a pre-processed version of the index is present in the list supplied or in the .hdf file and will use that layer when available.}

\item{e}{Extent object or object that can be coerced as extent.}

\item{mask}{Character or NULL. The name of the cloud/Land mask to be applied to the output (e.g.: \code{mask='fmask'})}

\item{keep}{Numeric. Can take multiple values. Which values of the mask layer should be kept?}

\item{L}{Numeric. Soil-adjustment factor for SAVI (ignored if vi != 'savi'). L can take on values between 0 and 1, and a default of 0.5 is typically used.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{\link{writeRaster}}}
}
\value{
A rasterLayer object
}
\description{
Extract layers, apply mask (optional), crop (optional), calculate NDVI (possible other indices supported in the future) and write output to file (optional)
