\title{Wrapper function to process Landsat data}
\usage{
processLandsat(x, vi = "ndvi", srdir, outdir, untar = TRUE,
  delete = FALSE, mask = NULL, L = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character. filename of the tarball or zip archive of the hdf/tiff file.}

\item{vi}{Character. Vegetation index to be computed or extracted from the archive. Can be either 'ndvi', 'evi', 'savi', 'ndmi'*, 'nbr', 'nbr2'* or 'msavi'*. Indices with * need to be present in the archive.}

\item{srdir}{Character. Directory where the tarball should be uncompressed. Can be ommited if \code{untar} is set to \code{FALSE}}

\item{outdir}{Character. Directory where the vegetation index rasterLayer should be written.}

\item{untar}{Logical. Is there a need to untar data, or have they been previously unpacked.}

\item{delete}{Logical. Should surface reflectance files (hdf/tiff) be deleted after vegetation index calculated? (usefull for disk space management; surface reflectance files are very voluminous and a user may want to keep the Landsat archive in compressed format only)}

\item{mask}{Character or NULL. The name of the mask to be applied to the bands (e.g.: \code{mask = 'fmask'})}

\item{L}{Numeric. Soil-adjustment factor for SAVI (ignored if vi != 'savi'). L can take on values between 0 and 1, and a default of 0.5 is typically used.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \link{sr2vi}. Do not specify \code{filename} since it is automatically generated}
}
\value{
rasterLayer Object also written to file (in \code{outdir}) with an automatically generated filename
}
\description{
Processes a single Landsat scene, from tarball or zip archive (or hdf/tiff if untar is set to FALSE) to vegetation index. Easy to batch using sapply or mclapply for parallel implementation. Data obtained from espi may already contained pre-processed indices layers, in which case they are directly used.

\examples{
# Get list of test data files
dir <- system.file('external', package='bfastSpatial')
list <- list.files(dir, full.names=TRUE)

# Set the location of output and intermediary directories (everything in tmpdir in that case)
srdir <- dirout <- file.path(rasterOptions()$tmpdir, 'bfmspatial')
dir.create(dirout, showWarning=FALSE)
# Generate (or extract, depending on whether the layer is already in the archive or not) NDVI for the first archive file
processLandsat(x=list[1], vi='ndvi', outdir=dirout, srdir=srdir, delete=TRUE, mask='fmask', keep=0, overwrite=TRUE)

# Visualize one of the layers produced
list <- list.files(dirout, pattern=glob2rx('*.grd'), full.names=TRUE)
plot(r <- raster(list[1]))
