\title{Apply bfmastmonitor on a single pixel}
\usage{
bfmPixel(x, dates = NULL, start, monend = NULL, cell = NULL, f = 1,
  min.thresh = NULL, sensor = NULL, interactive = FALSE, plot = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{RasterBrick with raster time series data.}

\item{start}{Numeric. Vector of length = 2 representing the start of the monitoring period (in the format c(year, julian day))}

\item{monend}{Numeric. Optional: the end of the monitoring period (in the format c(year, julian day)), at which point the time series will be trimmed.}

\item{cell}{Numeric. Can be one of: (1) a numeric of length 1 indicating the raster cell to be observed; (2) a numeric of length 2 representing the (x,y) coordinate of the raster cell to be observed. Can also be omitted, in which case 'interactive' must be set to TRUE (see below)}

\item{f}{Numeric. Factor by which to rescale values before running \code{bfastmonitor}. Defaults to 1 (no rescaling)}

\item{min.thresh}{Numeric. Optional: A minimum threshold below which NA's are assigned to data points. NOTE: the threshold is applied \emph{before} rescaling the data by \code{f} (see above)}

\item{sensor}{Character. Optional: Limit analysis to data from one or more sensors. Can be one or more of \code{c("ETM+", "ETM+ SLC-on", "ETM+ SLC-off", "TM", "OLI")} according to the sensor information returned by \code{\link{getSceneinfo}}}

\item{interactive}{Logical. Select cell by clicking on an already plotted map? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{FALSE}, a value must be assigned to \code{cell} (see above).}

\item{plot}{Logical. Plot the result? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{\link{bfastmonitor}}}
}
\value{
A list with the following components: 1) $bfm - an object of class 'bfastmonitor' (see \code{\link{bfastmonitor}}) 2) $cell - the cell index (an integer of length 1). This can be used to run \code{bfmPixel} again on the same pixel (with different parameters) without having to click on a plot again to find the same pixel (in that case, be sure to set interactive=FALSE for subsequent trials!).
}
\description{
Apply bfastmonitor (bfm) on a single pixel of known cell index (by supplying a single numeric value for cell), xy coordinates (\code{cell=c(x, y)}), or interactively by clicking on a plot (by setting \code{interactive=TRUE}). Outputs a list with (1) an object of class 'bfastmonitor' and (2) the resulting cell number (useful for follow-up analysis).
}
\details{
\code{bfmPixel} is theoretically designed to work on any generic raster time series, as long as a \code{dates} vector is provided. In the absence of a \code{dates} vector, \code{names(x)} should correspond exactly to respective Landsat scene ID's. In this case, \code{\link{getSceneinfo}} is used to extract a dates vector, and subset by sensor if desired.

# load in time series raster data

# run bfm on a pixel of known (x,y) location
bfm <- bfmPixel(tura, cell=c(820900, 831340), start=c(2005, 1))

# get bfm results for a pixel of known cell index

# try again using only ETM+ data (Landsat 7)

## change the model parameters
